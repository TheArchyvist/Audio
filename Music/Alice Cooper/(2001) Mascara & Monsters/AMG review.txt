Rhino's The Best of Alice Cooper presents a more concise alternative to 1999's mammoth, four-disc set The Life & Crimes of Alice Cooper. Like the box set, this album delivers digitally remastered versions of 22 of Cooper's best-known rock anthems, including "Eighteen," "School's Out," "Billion Dollar Babies," "Poison," and "Welcome to My Nightmare." Just thorough enough to please both casual fans and diehards, The Best of Alice Cooper is the most complete retrospective available on one disc. — Heather Phares
