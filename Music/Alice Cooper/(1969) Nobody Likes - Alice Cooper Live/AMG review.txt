Appearing in slightly different configurations with various names on various labels, this CD is for hardcore Cooper fans only. The music presented here is all extremely early material and is presented in studio versions on such albums as Freak Out. Even there, with well-produced recordings, the music is sometimes hard to take. However, in live format, it borders on unlistenable. This one is for Alice Cooper completists only. So, if that description fits you, by all means pick it up. Otherwise, stay far, far away. The one real highlight of the album, though, is "Nobody Likes Me," but a better rendition can be found on The Life & Crimes of Alice Cooper. Indeed, that compilation is a far better choice (albeit a pricier one) for getting material from this period of the band. — Gary Hill
